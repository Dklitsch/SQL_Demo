# SQL_Demo

This repo contains a variety of SQL commands intended to demo the various features of SQL. I've tried to use Kaggle's "Customer Personality Analysis" dataset for the examples where possible. It may be useful to SQL beginners to see these commands used in non-toy examples.

A SSIS package to set up the example data is available here: https://github.com/Dklitsch/SSIS_Demo.
